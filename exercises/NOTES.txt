Do edit your files, but do a git add when you feel it is complete...
then do a git commit with description. For instance your flow might look
like this:
git pull origin master
create and edit exercise1
git add exercise1
git commit with description
and then create and edit exercise 2
git add exercise2 when done
git commit with description... d
at the last exercise, in this case file 5...
Then we would do the final add
final commit
and finally we would push our code to master.
