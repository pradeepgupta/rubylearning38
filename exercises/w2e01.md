Exercise1. Write a program that processes the string a line at a time, using all that we have learned so far.

```ruby
s = "Welcome to the forum.\nHere you can learn Ruby.\nAlong with other members.\n"
```



The expected output is:
 
```
>ruby w2e1.rb

Line 1: Welcome to the forum.
Line 2: Here you can learn Ruby.
Line 3: Along with other members.
>Exit code: 0
```
