Read the sprintf documentation and the % documentation in the String class and 
figure out the output being printed by of this Ruby code.

```ruby
puts "%05d" % 123
```
ans will be 00000123

=> "0000000000234"
>> "%0.13d" % 234
=> "0000000000234"
>> "%13d" % 234
=> " 234"
>> "%2.2f" % 1.1
=> "1.10"
>> "%2.5f" % 1.1
=> "1.10000"
>> "%2.5f" % 1
=> "1.00000"

This exercise does give you a little practice on a couple ways to format a string. BUT the main purpose (with the benefit of knowing two ways to format strings) is that it shows you the documentation is sometimes making you chase answers.
