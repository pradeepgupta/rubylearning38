#Now We  know a bit more about numbers and strings, we'll start to add some players to the game. The goal of this exercise is to print out info about our initial player and a list of all the players. Here's the output we're shooting for:
#larry's health is 60
#
#Players:
#larry
#curly
#moe

name1= "larry"
name2= "curly"
health1= 60
puts "#{name1} health is #{health1}"
puts "Players:\nlarry\ncurly"
